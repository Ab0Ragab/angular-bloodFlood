          <h2>Reduces Iron Stores</h2>
          <p>
            Iron stimulates the body’s cells to release free radicals. These are unstable molecules that can lead to cancer and other diseases related to ageing such as diabetes. Too much iron is also linked to metabolic syndrome that is characterized by hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Studies show that many people take in more iron than their bodies actually need to maintain good health.

            By donating blood, you reduce iron stores in your body and, therefore, lower your risk of developing a number of diseases as well as keeping your heart healthy. With every blood donation, you lower the iron levels in your body and thus reduce your risk of getting many diseases.

           <h2>Improves Heart Health</h2>
           <p>
            Another surprising health benefit of donating blood regularly is the fact that it helps improve the health of your heart. Once again, high body iron stores come into play in the health of your body. High iron stores increase your risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, which is the other name for a heart attack. Therefore, by donating blood, you can reduce your risk by effectively decreasing your iron levels.

            According to a study, the risk of a heart attack was lower in people who regularly donated blood when compared to their counterparts who did not donate blood at all.

           <h2>You Get Free Blood Analysis</h2>
           <p>
            An obvious benefit to donating blood often is that you will get an up-to-date and free analysis of your blood. In addition to getting a basic health check, your blood will be checked out too. All blood must be tested for things like syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis before it can even be considered for donation. This means that labs will immediately pick up if something’s not right. You will be informed of any problems or health issues.

            Therefore, instead of heading to your nearest doctor and paying for a blood analysis, you can do a nice thing by donating blood and you will get a free analysis.

            <h2>You Feel Good for Helping</h2>
            <p>
                After donating blood, you can be sure that it will go toward helping someone who is in dire need of it. A person whose life may depend on it. Knowing that your blood went toward saving another human life is actually an amazing feeling. If you donate often, you’ll feel a sense of accomplishment that you cannot get for any amount of money.

                And who really doesn’t want to feel good knowing that they will most definitely lead to saving the life of a stranger? Although you will get no thanks for the act, it is a very satisfying and thoughtful thing to do. A feeling of the good person that you are.

          <h2>Improves Insulin Sensitivity</h2>
          <p>
            A little-known benefit of donating blood is the fact that frequent blood donations can help increase your insulin sensitivity. When your insulin sensitivity is low, the body, or more precisely, the pancreas, is put under a lot of pressure to produce more insulin.

            Your body requires insulin to transport sugar from the bloodstream into the cells. When the body has low insulin, it leads to chronic high blood pressure levels, which in turn can increase your risk of a number of diseases including heart disease and diabetes. With frequent donations, the body gets help to make better use of insulin.

            <h2>Lengthens Your Life</h2>
            <p>
                This goes without saying when you take into consideration all the aforementioned benefits. By donating blood regularly, there are many ways in which the body gets healthier. It lowers your iron stores, which lowers your risk for many diseases that would cause havoc on the body.

                You also burn calories, which is always a good thing for the body. Your risk of cancer is also lowered as well as the possibility of heart-related issues. Donating blood also leaves you feeling useful and good because you are contributing toward saving another person’s life. This has a good effect on the mind, which is an important component of a healthy, happy, and long life.

            <h2>Renews Your Blood Supply</h2>
            <p>
                When you donate blood, it naturally needs to be replenished. The body is a wonderful thing and will start getting on that immediately. Within 24 to 48 hours, your body would have replaced all the blood plasma that was lost, provided you didn’t donate more than a pint; in which case it may take longer to replace.

                This means that your body now has fresh blood supply pumping through the veins. This is a good thing because it helps the body remain healthy and function more efficiently. Your body will take longer to replenish the red blood cells. This usually happens within 4 to 8 weeks, and sometimes for 12 weeks or longer. This is not a health risk though.
